# PanoDiff

This reporsitory is intended to provide code for diffusion models and super resolution transformer to generate synthetic Panoramic Radiograph images. We utilise Diffusion model and SR Transformer to generate and then upscale the images. There are two modules within this folder (1) Diffusion to generate synthetic images in low resolution and (2) Super resolution to upscale the generated syhtnetic images. The colab notebook to test the pretrained model is available at `<Colab Link Here>`.

All pretrained models and project files can be requested at sanyam.jain@dent.au.dk
